üì± **Physical Device Deployment** üì±

Build, install, and validate BooksTrack on connected iOS device using XcodeBuildMCP.

**Tasks:**

1. **Device Discovery**
   - List all connected iOS devices via MCP
   - Show device name, model, iOS version, and UUID
   - Verify device is eligible for development builds

2. **Build for Device**
   - Clean build folder
   - Build Release configuration for selected device
   - Report build time and any errors

3. **Install on Device**
   - Install .app bundle on device via MCP
   - Verify installation success
   - Report app bundle size

4. **Launch & Monitor**
   - Launch BooksTrack on device
   - Stream device logs in real-time
   - Monitor for crashes, warnings, or errors
   - Check critical features:
     - CSV import with Live Activity
     - Search with space bar input
     - Book metadata editing
     - Enrichment progress

5. **Validation Report**
   - ‚úÖ Build successful
   - ‚úÖ Installation successful
   - ‚úÖ App launches without crash
