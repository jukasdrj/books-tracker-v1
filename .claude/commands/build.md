ðŸ”¨ **Quick Build Check** ðŸ”¨

Use XcodeBuildMCP to build BooksTracker.xcworkspace for iOS Simulator and report any issues.

**Tasks:**
1. Build for iPhone 17 Pro simulator (Debug configuration)
2. Parse compiler errors and warnings
3. Report build status with line numbers and file paths
4. Suggest fixes for any errors found
5. If build succeeds, confirm "âœ… Build passed - ready for testing!"

**Workspace:** BooksTracker.xcworkspace
**Scheme:** BooksTracker
**Destination:** iPhone 17 Pro (Simulator)
**Configuration:** Debug

This is for rapid iteration during development - full validation should use `/gogo`.
