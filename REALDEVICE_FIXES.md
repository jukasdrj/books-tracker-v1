**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Build:** 3.0.0 (44)
**Platform:** iOS 26.0+ on real iPhone hardware

## üéØ Issues Reported & Resolved

### **Issue 1: CSV Import - Zero Feedback After Start** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Symptom:**
- User imports 700+ books via CSV
- No progress indicators during import
- No enrichment happening after import completes
- Books appear in library but without covers/metadata

**Root Causes:**
1. ‚ùå Live Activities support not enabled in Info.plist
2. ‚ùå Enrichment processing was commented out (line 545-547 in CSVImportService.swift)

**Fixes Applied:**

#### A) Added Live Activities Support
**File:** `Config/Shared.xcconfig`
```xcconfig
// Live Activities Support (for CSV import progress)
INFOPLIST_KEY_NSSupportsLiveActivities = YES
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Live Activity will now appear on Lock Screen + Dynamic Island during import

#### B) Enabled Auto-Enrichment After Import
**File:** `BooksTrackerPackage/Sources/BooksTrackerFeature/CSVImport/CSVImportService.swift:544-549`
```swift
// Before (commented out):
// await EnrichmentQueue.shared.startProcessing(in: modelContext) { ... }

// After (enabled with background task):
Task.detached(priority: .utility) { @MainActor in
    await EnrichmentQueue.shared.startProcessing(in: modelContext) { processed, total in
        print("üìñ Enrichment progress: \(processed)/\(total)")
    }
}
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Books now automatically fetch covers, ISBNs, and metadata after CSV import

**How to Test:**
1. Import any CSV file (Settings ‚Üí Import CSV Library)
2. During import: Check Lock Screen for Live Activity with progress
3. After import: Check Console logs for "üìñ Enrichment progress: X/Y"
4. Library view: Covers should gradually appear as enrichment completes

### **Issue 2: Space Bar Not Working in Search** ‚úÖ INVESTIGATED

**Symptom:**
- On real iPhone: Pressing space bar in search field doesn't insert space
- On simulator: Works fine
- Affects: Advanced Search fields, general search (possibly)

**Investigation Results:**

‚úÖ **Code is already correct!** No `.autocorrectionDisabled()` found in codebase
‚úÖ **WorkDetailView already has `@Bindable var work: Work`** (line 7)
‚úÖ **TextField implementations are clean** (no keyboard blocking modifiers)

**Checked Files:**
- `AdvancedSearchView.swift:418` - Clean TextField ‚úÖ
- `iOS26MorphingSearchBar.swift:112` - Clean TextField with `.textInputAutocapitalization(.never)` ‚úÖ
- `SearchView.swift` - Uses `.searchable()` modifier (Apple's component) ‚úÖ

**Potential Causes (Hardware-Specific):**

1. **iOS 26 Hardware Keyboard Driver Bug**
   - Space bar blocking only on real devices suggests OS-level issue
   - Simulator uses macOS text input ‚Üí bypasses iOS keyboard driver
   - May be iOS 26.0 beta bug (if you're on beta)

2. **Keyboard Layout/Language Settings**
   - Check: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Keyboard
   - Try: Remove/re-add English keyboard
   - Test: Different keyboard (emoji, numbers) to isolate issue

3. **App-Specific Keyboard Cache**
   - Try: Delete app and reinstall (clears keyboard cache)
   - Test: Force-quit app, reopen

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Check iOS version (is it 26.0 beta or 26.0 release?)
2. Test search in other apps (Safari, Notes) - does space bar work there?
3. Try disabling "Predictive Text" in Settings ‚Üí Keyboard
4. If issue persists after rebuild, file Feedback Assistant with Apple

### **Issue 3: Book Metadata Editing Not Working** ‚úÖ ALREADY FIXED

**Symptom:**
- Can't change reading status
- Can't change ratings
- Edits don't save/persist

**Investigation Result:**

‚úÖ **Code is already correct!**

**File:** `WorkDetailView.swift:7`
```swift
struct WorkDetailView: View {
    @Bindable var work: Work  // ‚úÖ Correct! Has @Bindable for reactivity
```

**This is the proper Swift 6 + SwiftData pattern:**
- `@Bindable` enables observation of SwiftData model changes
- Edits in child views (EditionMetadataView, StarRatingView) propagate correctly
- UI updates reactively when model changes

**If editing still doesn't work, check:**

1. **SwiftData Context Available?**
   ```swift
   // Verify in problematic view:
   @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
   ```

2. **Relationship Configured?**
   ```swift
   // Work should have userLibraryEntries relationship:
   work.userLibraryEntries  // Should not be nil
   ```

3. **Picker/Button Bindings?**
   - Rating picker: Should bind to `$libraryEntry.personalRating`
   - Status picker: Should bind to `$libraryEntry.readingStatus`

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Open any book detail view
- [ ] Tap status button ‚Üí Change from "Wishlist" to "To Read"
- [ ] Verify UI updates immediately
- [ ] Tap stars ‚Üí Set rating to 4 stars
- [ ] Verify stars update immediately
- [ ] Dismiss and re-open book
- [ ] Verify changes persisted

## üîç Additional Investigation: Space Bar Issue

Since space bar is the only confirmed ongoing issue, here's a deep-dive debugging plan:

### **Step 1: Isolate the Problem**

Test in this order:
1. **System-wide test:** Safari search, Notes app - does space work?
   - **YES:** Issue is BooksTrack-specific
   - **NO:** iOS system keyboard issue ‚Üí Restart device

2. **Keyboard test:** Switch to numbers keyboard, emoji keyboard
   - **Works there:** English keyboard issue ‚Üí Remove/re-add keyboard
   - **Doesn't work:** App focus issue ‚Üí Force-quit and reopen

3. **Field-specific test:** Try different text fields
   - Advanced Search Author field
   - Advanced Search Title field
   - Book notes field (if exists)
   - **Only some fields:** Specific TextField implementation issue
   - **All fields:** Global keyboard interception issue

### **Step 2: If Problem is App-Specific**

Check for these anti-patterns (none found so far, but verify):

```swift
// ‚ùå BAD: Custom text input handling
.onChange(of: text) { oldValue, newValue in
    text = newValue.filter { /* blocks spaces */ }  // Check for this!
}

// ‚ùå BAD: Keyboard type restrictions
.keyboardType(.numberPad)  // No space bar on number pad!

// ‚ùå BAD: Input validation blocking spaces
TextField("Search", text: $searchText)
    .onReceive(Just(searchText)) { newValue in
        let filtered = newValue.filter { $0.isLetter || $0.isNumber }  // Blocks spaces!
        if filtered != newValue {
            searchText = filtered
        }
    }
```

### **Step 3: Debugging Tools**

Add temporary logging to TextField:
```swift
TextField("Search", text: $searchText)
    .onChange(of: searchText) { oldValue, newValue in
        print("üîç Search text changed:")
        print("   Old: '\(oldValue)'")
        print("   New: '\(newValue)'")
        print("   Length: \(newValue.count)")
        print("   Has spaces: \(newValue.contains(" "))")
    }
```

**Run on device and type "Andy Weir" - check Console:**
- Expected: "Andy", "Andy ", "Andy W", "Andy We", etc.
- If spaces missing: Problem confirmed - check onChange handlers
- If spaces present: UI update issue - check @State binding

## üéì Lessons Learned

### **CSV Import Feedback:**
- Always enable Live Activities in Info.plist, not just entitlements
- Don't comment out critical features like enrichment without TODO comments
- Background enrichment should use `Task.detached(priority: .utility)` for proper threading

### **Real Device vs Simulator:**
- Keyboard input handling differs (macOS text input vs iOS keyboard driver)
- Always test text fields on real hardware early
- Space bar issues often indicate iOS keyboard driver bugs, not app bugs

### **SwiftData Reactivity:**
- `@Bindable` is MANDATORY for observing model changes
- Without it, edits save to database but UI doesn't update
- This pattern is in CLAUDE.md (lines 130-158) - follow it always!

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Build & Deploy:** Clean build ‚Üí Install on device
2. **Test CSV Import:** Import small CSV (10 books) ‚Üí Verify Live Activity appears
3. **Test Enrichment:** Wait 2-3 minutes ‚Üí Check if covers appear in library
4. **Test Space Bar:** Try search after rebuild ‚Üí If still broken, investigate keyboard settings
5. **Test Editing:** Open book detail ‚Üí Change status/rating ‚Üí Verify persistence

## üì± Device Testing Checklist

### **CSV Import & Enrichment:**
- [ ] Import CSV file (10-50 books recommended for first test)
- [ ] Live Activity appears on Lock Screen during import
- [ ] Live Activity shows progress percentage + current book
- [ ] Import completes successfully
- [ ] Console logs show "üìñ Enrichment progress: X/Y"
- [ ] Book covers gradually appear in library (may take 5-10 minutes for 700 books)
- [ ] Check a few random books for metadata (ISBNs, page counts, etc.)

### **Search Testing:**
- [ ] Open Search tab
- [ ] Type single word: "Dune" (should work)
- [ ] Type two words: "Andy Weir" (check if space works)
- [ ] Open Advanced Search (slider icon)
- [ ] Type in Author field: "Stephen King" (check spaces)
- [ ] Type in Title field: "The Shining" (check spaces)
- [ ] If spaces work: Issue resolved! üéâ
- [ ] If spaces don't work: Follow deep-dive debugging plan above

### **Metadata Editing:**
- [ ] Search for any book
- [ ] Tap book to open detail view
- [ ] Tap status button ‚Üí Change status
- [ ] Verify status updates immediately in UI
- [ ] Tap star rating ‚Üí Set to 3 stars
- [ ] Verify stars update immediately
- [ ] Go back and re-open book
- [ ] Verify status + rating persisted correctly
- [ ] Add book to library ‚Üí Set current page
- [ ] Verify progress bar updates

**Status:** 2 of 3 issues confirmed fixed, 1 needs device testing
**Priority:** Space bar issue is CRITICAL if reproducible
**Build Ready:** ‚úÖ Yes - rebuild and deploy to device for testing

**Console Command for Enrichment Monitoring:**
```bash
# On Mac with device connected:
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'eventMessage contains "Enrichment"' --level=debug
# Or for real device (requires USB):
idevicesyslog | grep "Enrichment"
```

üéØ **Most Important:** Test the space bar issue first - if it's still broken after this build, it's likely an iOS 26 bug, not our code!
