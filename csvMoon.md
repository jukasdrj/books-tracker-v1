Refined To-Do List: CSV Import V1

**Status: Phase 0 & 1 COMPLETE ✅ | Updated: October 2025**

Objective: This document translates the csvMoon.md strategy into a granular, actionable checklist for the development team. It incorporates lessons from previous large-scale data projects, focusing on robustness and user experience.

---

## Phase 0: Foundational Prerequisites ✅ COMPLETE

Goal: Ensure the core application components exist before building the import feature.

[✅] **Project Setup:**
- [✅] BooksTracker Xcode workspace with SwiftUI and SwiftData
- [✅] BooksTrackerPackage (SPM) for shared models, views, and services

[✅] **Core Data Model:**
- [✅] Work, Edition, Author, UserLibraryEntry @Model classes
- [✅] All enrichment fields are optional (CloudKit-compatible)
- [✅] Relationship structure: Work 1:many Edition, Work many:many Author, Work 1:many UserLibraryEntry

[✅] **Basic UI Shell:**
- [✅] TabView with Library, Search, and Settings tabs
- [✅] LibraryView displays UserLibraryEntry objects from SwiftData

---

## Phase 1: High-Performance Import & Enrichment Queue ✅ COMPLETE

Goal: Build the core engine for parsing, importing, and queueing books for background metadata enrichment.

### CSV Parsing & Initial Import

[✅] **UIDocumentPickerViewController Integration**
- Location: `SettingsView.swift` → Sheet presentation of `CSVImportFlowView`
- File selection from Files app, iCloud Drive, and other providers

[✅] **CSVParser with Stream-Based Parsing**
- Implementation: `BooksTrackerPackage/Sources/BooksTrackerFeature/CSVImport/CSVParsingActor.swift`
- **Smart Column Detection:** Auto-detects Goodreads, LibraryThing, StoryGraph formats
- **Memory-Efficient:** Processes files in chunks, never loads entire file in memory
- **Batch Processing:** Saves to SwiftData in batches of 50-100 books

[✅] **Duplicate Handling Strategy**
- Implementation: `CSVImportService.swift` → `checkForDuplicates()`
- **Detection:** ISBN-based primary check, Title+Author fallback
- **User Options:** Skip duplicates, Overwrite existing, Create copies
- **UI:** `DuplicateResolutionView.swift` with clear conflict presentation

[✅] **Background Actor Processing**
- **CSVParsingActor:** `@globalActor` for background CSV parsing
- **Batch Saves:** Periodic saves every 200 books to prevent memory pressure
- **Progress Updates:** Real-time progress reporting via AsyncStream
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of malformed rows

[✅] **ReadingStatus Parser**
- Location: `UserLibraryEntry.swift` → `ReadingStatus.from(string:)`
- **Format Support:** Goodreads ("to-read", "currently-reading", "read")
- **Format Support:** LibraryThing ("owned", "reading", "finished")
- **Format Support:** StoryGraph ("want to read", "in progress", "completed")
- **Fuzzy Matching:** Partial string matching for flexible input

### Enrichment Service

[✅] **EnrichmentService Implementation**
- Location: `BooksTrackerPackage/Sources/BooksTrackerFeature/CSVImport/EnrichmentService.swift`
- **MainActor-isolated:** Direct SwiftData compatibility
- **API Integration:** Calls `books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search/auto`
- **Smart Matching:** Title + Author scoring algorithm for best result selection
- **Metadata Enrichment:** Cover images, ISBNs, publication years, page counts, external IDs
- **Statistics Tracking:** Success/failure rates, performance metrics
- **Error Handling:** Retry logic with exponential backoff

[✅] **PriorityQueue Manager**
- Location: `BooksTrackerPackage/Sources/BooksTrackerFeature/CSVImport/EnrichmentQueue.swift`
- **MainActor-isolated:** Thread-safe queue operations
- **FIFO Ordering:** First-in-first-out with priority override capability
- **Persistent Storage:** Queue state saved to UserDefaults across app launches
- **Re-prioritization API:** `prioritize(workID:)` moves items to front
- **Batch Processing:** `enqueueBatch(_:)` for efficient bulk operations
- **Background Processing:** `startProcessing(in:progressHandler:)` with progress callbacks

**Optimization:** Queue supports dynamic re-prioritization. Example: User scrolls to unenriched book → `prioritize(workID:)` → enriched immediately.

### Testing

[✅] **Comprehensive Test Suite**
- Location: `BooksTrackerPackage/Tests/BooksTrackerFeatureTests/CSVImportEnrichmentTests.swift`
- **20+ Test Cases:** ReadingStatus parsing, queue operations, CSV detection, row parsing
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end import flow, enrichment statistics
- **Performance Tests:** Large CSV file handling (1500+ books)

### Integration

[✅] **CSVImportService Integration**
- `queueWorksForEnrichment(_:)` method automatically queues imported books
- Post-import workflow: CSV import → Stub creation → Queue population → Background enrichment

---

## Phase 2: Cloudflare Worker & Background Execution

Goal: Offload API requests to a secure, scalable worker and ensure the enrichment process continues even when the app is not in the foreground.

### Cloudflare Worker Setup (ALREADY EXISTS ✅)

[✅] **books-api-proxy Worker**
- Endpoint: `https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search/auto`
- **Multi-Provider Orchestration:** Google Books, OpenLibrary, ISBNdb
- **Smart Caching:** KV store with intelligent cache warming
- **Service Bindings:** RPC communication with specialized workers
- **Response Format:** Standardized JSON with book metadata

[✅] **Supporting Workers**
- `personal-library-cache-warmer`: Pre-warms popular author caches
- `google-books-worker`: Google Books API wrapper
- `openlibrary-worker`: OpenLibrary API wrapper
- `isbndb-biography-worker`: Author biography enhancement

### iOS Background Task Management (TODO)

[ ] **BackgroundTaskManager Implementation**
- [ ] Create `BackgroundTaskManager` to register BGAppRefreshTask
- [ ] Trigger EnrichmentService to process queue items when background task fires
- [ ] Limit to 5-10 items per background session (respect execution time limits)

[ ] **State Persistence**
- [✅] EnrichmentQueue saves state to UserDefaults (COMPLETE)
- [ ] Restore queue on app launch
- [ ] Resume enrichment process seamlessly after termination

[ ] **Network Monitoring**
- [ ] Integrate `NetworkPathMonitor` for connection quality detection
- [ ] Only run background enrichment on suitable connections (Wi-Fi preferred)
- [ ] Pause/resume based on network availability

---

## Phase 3: Live Activity & User Feedback (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)

Goal: Provide a best-in-class user experience by showing real-time import and enrichment progress.

### Live Activity Implementation

[✅] **ActivityAttributes Definition**
- Location: `BooksTrackerPackage/Sources/BooksTrackerFeature/CSVImport/ImportActivityAttributes.swift`
- **Dynamic Data:** `booksImported`, `booksEnriched`, `totalBooks`, `currentPhase`
- **State Tracking:** Import phase vs enrichment phase

[ ] **Live Activity UI (TODO)**
- [ ] Design Lock Screen presentation (compact and expanded views)
- [ ] Design Dynamic Island presentation (minimal and expanded states)
- [ ] Implement iOS 26 Liquid Glass design system integration
- [ ] Add progress animations and visual feedback

[ ] **LiveActivityManager (TODO)**
- [ ] Create manager to start/update/end Live Activity
- [ ] Integrate with CSVImportService for import progress
- [ ] Integrate with EnrichmentService for enrichment progress
- [ ] Handle activity lifecycle (start on import, update during enrichment, end on completion)

### In-App Progress UI

[ ] **Progress Banner (TODO)**
- [ ] Design persistent banner component (top of Library/Settings tab)
- [ ] Real-time progress updates matching Live Activity data
- [ ] Dismissible after completion
- [ ] Action buttons (Cancel, View Details, Dismiss)
- [ ] iOS 26 Liquid Glass styling with theme-aware colors

[ ] **Progress Detail View (TODO)**
- [ ] Detailed import statistics (books imported, failed, duplicates skipped)
- [ ] Enrichment progress (books enriched, pending, failed)
- [ ] Error log with retry options
- [ ] Export report feature

---

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions

**Swift 6 Concurrency:**
- MainActor isolation for SwiftData operations (EnrichmentService, EnrichmentQueue)
- @globalActor (CSVParsingActor) for background CSV processing
- AsyncStream for progress updates
- Proper actor isolation prevents data races

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Stream-based CSV parsing (no full file load)
- Batch saves every 50-100 books (memory efficiency)
- Smart duplicate detection (ISBN primary, Title+Author fallback)
- Priority queue with re-prioritization (user-driven enrichment)

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful malformed row handling
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Success/failure statistics tracking
- User-friendly error messages
