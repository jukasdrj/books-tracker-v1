## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Multi-Format Parsing**: Handled two different CSV schemas
   - Original: `year,title,author,isbn13`
   - New: `Title,Author,ISBN-13`

2. **Advanced Deduplication**:
   - Primary key: ISBN-13 normalization
   - Secondary key: Title + Author combination
   - Fuzzy matching for text normalization

3. **ISBN Validation & Normalization**:
   - Removed dashes, spaces, and formatting
   - Validated 13-digit structure
   - Flagged invalid formats for review

4. **Quality Assurance**:
   - 6 ISBN issues identified and documented
   - 82 duplicate pairs detected and consolidated
   - Data structure validation passed

### Upload Process
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /upload-csv`
- **Validation**: Server-side CSV parsing and validation
- **Storage**: Automated R2 backup with metadata
- **Integration**: Immediate availability for cache warming
