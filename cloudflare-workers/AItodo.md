# AI Bookshelf Scanning Feature: To-Do List

This document outlines the completed work and the remaining tasks for the AI-powered bookshelf scanning feature.

## Completed

### Cloudflare Worker (`books-api-proxy`)

*   **New Endpoint:** Created a new endpoint at `/api/scan-bookshelf` that accepts `POST` requests with image data.
*   **CORS Update:** Updated the CORS configuration to allow `POST` requests.
*   **Mocked Response:** The endpoint currently returns a mocked JSON response with sample book data, allowing the iOS app to be tested independently of the final AI implementation.

### iOS App (`BooksTrackerPackage`)

*   **Camera Capture:** The `CameraManager` has been enhanced to support capturing high-resolution still images.
*   **Dedicated Camera View:** A new `BookshelfCameraView` has been created to provide a live camera feed and a capture button.
*   **UI Integration:** The `BookshelfScannerView` has been refactored to use the new `BookshelfCameraView`, replacing the previous `PhotosPicker`-based workflow.
*   **Image Upload:** The app now uploads the captured image to the `/api/scan-bookshelf` endpoint on the Cloudflare worker.
*   **Updated Privacy Notice:** The privacy banner in the UI has been updated to inform the user that the photo will be uploaded for analysis.

## To Do

### Cloudflare Worker (`books-api-proxy`)

*   **AI Integration:** The core task remaining is to replace the mocked response in the `handleBookshelfScan` function in `index.js` with a real implementation. This involves:
    *   Receiving the image data from the `POST` request.
    *   Sending the image to an AI service (e.g., Google Gemini via its API) for book detection.
    *   Processing the AI's response.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for the AI service integration (e.g., API errors, timeouts, invalid responses).
*   **Image Quality Feedback:** Investigate if the chosen AI service can provide feedback on the image quality. If so, incorporate this into the API response sent back to the app.

### iOS App (`BooksTrackerPackage`)

*   **Worker URL:** The placeholder URL in `BookshelfScannerView.swift` needs to be replaced with the actual URL of your deployed Cloudflare worker.
*   **Display AI Feedback:** If the API provides image quality feedback, enhance the UI to display this information to the user (e.g., "Image is too blurry, please retake").
*   **Error Handling:** Add more specific error handling and user-facing alerts for network errors during image upload or for error responses from the worker.
