### Final State ✅

| Worker | Wrangler Version | Status |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Global** | 4.42.2 | ✅ Latest |
| **books-api-proxy** | 4.42.2 | ✅ Up-to-date |
| **bookshelf-ai-worker** | 4.42.2 | ✅ Up-to-date |
| **personal-library-cache-warmer** | 4.42.2 | ✅ Up-to-date |
| **external-apis-worker** | 4.42.2 | ✅ Up-to-date |

### Functionality Tests ✅

All workers tested and verified:
- ✅ `wrangler --version` returns 4.42.2
- ✅ `wrangler deployments list` retrieves deployment history
- ✅ `wrangler.toml` configurations parse correctly
- ✅ Authentication working (jukasdrj@gmail.com)

### Note: logpush Warning

The warning about `logpush = true` in `[observability]` is **informational only**:
```toml
[observability]
enabled = true
logpush = true  # ← This is CORRECT syntax for Wrangler v4!
```

**Why the warning?** Wrangler v4 now supports more observability options, and the warning just alerts you to the field's presence. The configuration is **valid and working correctly**.

### Benefits Achieved 🚀

1. **Consistency:** All workers now use the same Wrangler version
2. **Modern Features:** Access to latest Wrangler v4 capabilities
3. **Bug Fixes:** Inherit all v4 stability improvements
4. **Maintainability:** Standard package.json structure across all workers
5. **Developer Experience:** Consistent CLI commands and behavior

### Available Commands (All Workers)

```bash
npm run dev      # Local development with hot reload
npm run deploy   # Deploy to Cloudflare
npm run tail     # Stream logs with pretty formatting
```

### Migration Notes

**Breaking Changes from v3 → v4:**
- None encountered in our codebase ✅
- All existing `wrangler.toml` configurations remain valid
- Service bindings, KV namespaces, R2 buckets all working

**Next Steps:**
- Consider enabling more observability features (head_sampling_rate)
- Review new Wrangler v4 features for potential optimizations
- Monitor deployment logs for any unexpected behavior
