# BOOKSHELF SCANNING API - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Quick Reference Guide** | **Full Documentation:** [BOOKSHELF_SCANNING_API_ARCHITECTURE.md](./BOOKSHELF_SCANNING_API_ARCHITECTURE.md)

## TL;DR RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. GEMINI API OPTIMIZATION

**CRITICAL ADDITION: Confidence Scoring**

Current schema is missing confidence fields. Add this immediately:

```javascript
confidence: {
  type: "OBJECT",
  properties: {
    title: { type: "NUMBER" },
    author: { type: "NUMBER" },
    isbn: { type: "NUMBER" },
    overall: { type: "NUMBER" }
  }
}
```

**Why:** Enables intelligent filtering, reduces wasted API calls, improves user trust.

**Impact:** Process only high-confidence detections (>0.7), skip low-confidence (<0.4), save 30-50% on enrichment costs.

---

### 2. RECOMMENDED ARCHITECTURE

**WINNER: Hybrid Approach (Option D)**

```
iOS App
  ↓ Upload image (3-4MB)
Bookshelf AI Worker (Direct Call)
  ↓ Return detections in 25-40s
iOS App displays results IMMEDIATELY
  ↓ Background enrichment (parallel)
Books API Proxy (search high-confidence books only)
  ↓ Progressive UI updates as results arrive
Complete in 40-50s total (user sees results at 30s!)
```

**Why Hybrid Wins:**
- User sees results in 30s (not 60s like proxy orchestration)
- Simple architecture (no Durable Objects, no polling)
- Cost-efficient (only enriches high-confidence detections)
- Fault-tolerant (enrichment failures don't block detection display)

**Rejected Alternatives:**
- Option B (Proxy Orchestration): Too slow (60s wait), poor UX
- Option C (Async Queue): Over-engineered for this use case

---

### 3. ISBN DETECTION STRATEGY

**REALITY CHECK:** ISBNs are on back covers, NOT spines (<1% visible in bookshelf photos).

**RECOMMENDED STRATEGY:**
1. Request ISBN from Gemini (in case of rare edge cases)
2. PRIMARY method: Title+Author search (90%+ success rate)
3. Fallback: Title-only or Author-only search
4. Last resort: Manual search

**DO NOT** depend on ISBN detection for bookshelf scanning. It will fail 99% of the time.

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Phase 1: Immediate (This Sprint)

- [ ] Add confidence scoring to AI worker schema (lines 196-243 in bookshelf-ai-worker/src/index.js)
- [ ] Enhance Gemini prompt with confidence instructions
- [ ] Implement post-processing pipeline (deduplication, normalization)
- [ ] Deploy hybrid iOS architecture (instant display + progressive enrichment)

### Phase 2: Short-Term (Next Sprint)

- [ ] Add image quality gates (reject poor scans early)
- [ ] Implement quota tracking (5 scans/day free, 100/day pro)
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling + user-friendly messages
- [ ] Internal beta testing (10 users, 1 week)

### Phase 3: Production (Next Month)

- [ ] User feedback loop ("Was this detection correct?")
- [ ] A/B test prompt variations
- [ ] Cache popular books (Harry Potter, LOTR, etc.)
- [ ] Gradual rollout (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)

---

## KEY METRICS TO TRACK

**Success Criteria:**
- AI processing time: <35s average
- Detection success rate: >95%
- Enrichment success rate: >90%
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5 stars
- Cost per scan: <$0.001

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Processing time >50s → Investigate
- Success rate <90% → Rollback
- Daily spend >$10 → Pause feature
- Error rate >5% → Emergency investigation

---

## COST PROJECTIONS

**Gemini API Pricing:**
- $0.00025 per image (typical bookshelf)
- Free tier: 1,500 requests/day (enough for beta)

**Monthly Cost Estimates:**
- 100 scans/day = $0.75/month
- 1,000 scans/day = $7.50/month
- 10,000 scans/day = $75/month

**Cost Optimization:**
- Compress images to 1920x1080, 80% JPEG quality
- Cache results by image hash (1-hour TTL)
- Only enrich high-confidence detections (saves 30-50% on API calls)

---

## API ENDPOINT QUICK REFERENCE

### Bookshelf AI Worker

**POST /scan**
- Upload: 3-4MB JPEG (max 10MB)
- Response: 25-40s
- Returns: `{ books: [...], metadata: {...} }`

### Books API Proxy

**POST /search/advanced**
- Query: `?title=...&author=...&maxResults=3`
- Response: <2s (cached)
- Returns: Book metadata + cover images

**POST /search/isbn**
- Query: `?q=9780547928227`
- Use only when ISBN detected (rare)

## SAMPLE iOS INTEGRATION

```swift
// 1. Scan bookshelf (show loading spinner)
let detections = try await scanBookshelf(image) // 25-40s

// 2. Display results immediately (no waiting!)
await displayResults(detections) // 0s

// 3. Enrich high-confidence books in background
await enrichDetections(detections) // Progressive updates

// Total user-perceived time: 30s (not 60s!)
```

## SECURITY CHECKLIST

- [x] Gemini API key in Cloudflare Secrets Store (not exposed to iOS)
- [x] MIME type validation (reject non-images)
- [x] Size limits enforced (10MB max)
- [ ] Rate limiting (10 requests/hour per IP)
- [ ] CORS restricted to iOS app domain
- [ ] Image sanitization (reject SVG, etc.)
- [ ] Quota tracking (prevent abuse)

## TESTING SCENARIOS

| Scenario | Expected Result | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Well-lit, straight-on (10 books) | 9-10 detections, 90%+ confidence | |
| Dim lighting (10 books) | 7-9 detections, 60-80% confidence | |
| Heavy angle (10 books) | 5-7 detections, 40-60% confidence | |
| Backlit image | Reject with "poor image quality" | |
| Foreign language books | Detect in original language | |
| Damaged spines | Bounding boxes detected, text null | |
| Image >10MB | Reject with size error | |

---

## ROLLOUT STRATEGY

**Week 1:** Internal beta (10 users)
**Week 2-3:** Limited beta (100 users)
**Week 4:** 10% rollout
**Week 5:** 25% rollout
**Week 6:** 50% rollout
**Week 7:** 100% rollout

**Rollback Trigger:** Error rate >5%, success rate <90%, or daily cost >$10.

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Review full architecture document** (28,000 words): [BOOKSHELF_SCANNING_API_ARCHITECTURE.md](./BOOKSHELF_SCANNING_API_ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. **Implement Phase 1 changes** (confidence scoring + hybrid architecture)
3. **Test with 20+ diverse bookshelf images** (validate accuracy)
4. **Deploy to staging environment** (internal beta)
5. **Monitor metrics daily** (processing time, success rate, costs)
6. **Iterate based on real data** (fine-tune prompts/thresholds)
