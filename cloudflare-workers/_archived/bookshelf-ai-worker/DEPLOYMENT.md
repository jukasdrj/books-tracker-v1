## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/justingardner/Downloads/xcode/books-tracker-v1/cloudflare-workers/bookshelf-ai-worker
npm install
```

### Step 2: Test Locally (Optional)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:8787 in your browser to test the HTML interface.

**Test Workflow:**
1. Upload a bookshelf photo
2. Click "üîç Scan Bookshelf"
3. Verify bounding boxes appear
4. Check JSON output for accuracy

**‚ö†Ô∏è Local Testing Limitations:**
- Uses your actual Gemini API key (counts against quota)
- Requires internet connection to call Gemini API
- Press Ctrl+C to stop local server

### Step 3: Deploy to Production

```bash
npm run deploy
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Total Upload: XX.XX KiB / gzip: XX.XX KiB
Uploaded bookshelf-ai-worker (X.XX sec)
Published bookshelf-ai-worker (X.XX sec)
  https://bookshelf-ai-worker.YOUR_ACCOUNT.workers.dev
Current Deployment ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

#### Health Check
```bash
curl https://bookshelf-ai-worker.YOUR_ACCOUNT.workers.dev/health | jq
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T18:30:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Test Scan (with sample image)
```bash
curl -X POST https://bookshelf-ai-worker.YOUR_ACCOUNT.workers.dev/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \
  --data-binary @/path/to/test-bookshelf.jpg \
  | jq '.metadata'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "processingTime": 4200,
  "detectedCount": 15,
  "readableCount": 12,
  "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T18:30:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Browser Test
1. Open `https://bookshelf-ai-worker.YOUR_ACCOUNT.workers.dev` in browser
2. Use HTML interface to upload test image
3. Verify visual bounding boxes align with book spines

## üìä Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Real-Time Logs

```bash
npm run tail
```

**What to Watch For:**
- `[BookshelfAI] Starting scan` - Request received
- `[BookshelfAI] Scan completed: X books detected in Yms` - Success
- `[BookshelfAI] Scan failed:` - Errors (investigate immediately)

### Common Success Patterns

```
[BookshelfAI] Starting scan, image size: 2453120 bytes
[BookshelfAI] Scan completed: 15 books detected in 4200ms
```

### Common Error Patterns

```
‚ùå GEMINI_API_KEY not configured
   ‚Üí Run: wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY

‚ùå Gemini API Error: 429 Too Many Requests
   ‚Üí Rate limit exceeded (15 RPM free tier)
   ‚Üí Wait 1 minute or upgrade to paid tier

‚ùå Image too large. Max 10MB
   ‚Üí Client needs to compress image before upload

‚ùå Invalid response structure from Gemini API
   ‚Üí Gemini API issue, check status.cloud.google.com
```

---

## üîß Configuration Tuning

### Adjust Image Size Limit

```toml
# wrangler.toml
[vars]
MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_MB = "5"  # Reduce to 5MB for faster uploads
```

### Adjust Timeout

```toml
# wrangler.toml
[vars]
REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS = "20000"  # Reduce to 20s for faster failures
```

### Change AI Model (Future)

```toml
# wrangler.toml
[vars]
AI_MODEL = "gemini-2.5-pro-preview"  # Slower but more accurate
```

---

## üìà Performance Baselines

### First 24 Hours Target Metrics

| Metric | Target | Action if Below |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Success Rate** | >95% | Check Gemini API status |
| **Avg Processing Time** | <6s | Review image sizes |
| **Detection Rate** | >80% | Adjust prompt or model |
| **Readable Rate** | >60% | Expected (blurry spines) |

### Analytics Queries

```bash
# View analytics in Cloudflare Dashboard
wrangler analytics
```

**Key Questions:**
1. How many scans per day?
2. What's the average processing time?
3. Are there any 500 errors?
4. What's the peak usage time?

---

## üîó Integration with iOS App (Next Phase)

### Current Endpoint (Standalone)

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://bookshelf-ai-worker.YOUR_ACCOUNT.workers.dev/scan")!
```

### Future Endpoint (RPC via books-api-proxy)

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/scan/bookshelf")!
```

**Migration Timeline:**
- Week 1: Standalone testing
- Week 2: RPC integration (if POC succeeds)
- Week 3: iOS client implementation
- Week 4: Beta testing

---

## üêõ Rollback Procedure

### If deployment fails or causes issues:

```bash
# View deployment history
wrangler deployments list

# Rollback to previous version
wrangler rollback --message "Rollback due to [issue]"
```

### Emergency Disable

```bash
# Delete worker temporarily
wrangler delete

# iOS app will fall back to local Vision framework
```

---

## üí∞ Cost Monitoring

### Daily Cost Estimate

```
Scans per day √ó $0.0012 = Daily cost

Examples:
- 50 scans/day = $0.06/day = $1.80/month
- 100 scans/day = $0.12/day = $3.60/month
- 500 scans/day = $0.60/day = $18/month
```

### Billing Alerts

Set up alerts in Google Cloud Console:
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
2. Set budget alert at $10/month
3. Receive email if approaching limit

---

## ‚úÖ Deployment Success Criteria

### You're Ready for Beta If:

- [x] Health check returns 200 OK
- [x] Test scan completes in <8s
- [x] Bounding boxes align with book spines (¬±5%)
- [x] JSON structure matches schema
- [x] Logs show no errors for 10 test scans
- [x] Browser HTML interface works smoothly
- [x] Cost projections are acceptable (<$10/month for personal use)

### Next Steps After Successful Deployment:

1. **Document Production URL** in CLAUDE.md
2. **Test with 20+ diverse bookshelf photos** (lighting, angles, spine conditions)
3. **Measure accuracy metrics** (detection rate, readable rate)
4. **Create iOS client integration branch**
5. **Plan RPC integration** with books-api-proxy
