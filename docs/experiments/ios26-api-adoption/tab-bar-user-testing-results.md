## Recommendation

_[Select ONE and provide detailed reasoning]_

### ✅ SHIP (Feature Enabled by Default)
**Reasoning:**
- All 3 testers discovered feature naturally
- Discovery time average: _[X sec]_ (well under 5 sec threshold)
- Zero frustration observed
- All testers successfully switched tabs
- Accessibility safeguards working as designed
- Feature enhances immersive reading experience without usability cost

**Action:** Keep `enableTabBarMinimize = true` in FeatureFlags.swift

---

### ⚠️ CONDITIONAL SHIP (Add First-Launch Hint)
**Reasoning:**
- Discovery time: _[X sec]_ (borderline)
- Some mild confusion observed: _[describe]_
- Feature works but discoverability could be improved
- Suggest adding tooltip/hint on first launch

**Action:**
- Add first-launch hint: "Scroll down to hide tab bar for immersive reading"
- Keep feature enabled
- Monitor App Store reviews for 100 downloads

---

### ❌ DON'T SHIP (Disable by Default)
**Reasoning:**
- Discovery time: _[X sec]_ (exceeded 5 sec threshold)
- Frustration observed: _[describe specific incidents]_
- Tab switching difficulty: _[X/3 testers struggled]_
- Feature causes more confusion than value

**Action:**
- Set `enableTabBarMinimize = false` in FeatureFlags.swift
- Keep toggle in Settings for power users who want to opt-in
- Revisit in future release with improved discoverability
