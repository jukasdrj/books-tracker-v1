# iOS 26 API Adoption - Lessons Learned

**Last Updated:** October 18, 2025
**Purpose:** Capture behavioral insights, gotchas, and patterns discovered during iOS 26 API implementation

---

## Overview

This document serves as a knowledge base for iOS 26 API behaviors, simulator vs. device differences, and reusable patterns for future iOS development.

---

## Device vs. Simulator Differences

### Visual Effects
_To be populated as visual effects are implemented and tested..._

**Expected Patterns:**
- Blur effects typically render differently on device
- Transparency and glass materials may show performance differences
- Color blending modes (overlay, multiply) often appear more saturated on physical hardware

**Testing Protocol:**
- Always validate visual effects on physical iPhone/iPad
- Screenshot both simulator and device for comparison
- Note iOS version and device model for reproduction

---

## API Naming Patterns

iOS 26 introduces consistent naming conventions for behavior controls:

### Suffix Patterns

**`Behavior` Suffix** ‚Üí Runtime behavior controls
- Example: `.scrollBounceBehavior`, `.tabBarMinimizeBehavior`
- Purpose: Control how components respond to user interactions
- Values: Typically enums (`.automatic`, `.basedOnSize`, `.onScrollDown`, etc.)

**`Style` Suffix** ‚Üí Visual appearance modifiers
- Example: `.scrollEdgeEffectStyle`
- Purpose: Control visual presentation without affecting behavior
- Values: Visual descriptors (`.soft`, `.prominent`, `.minimal`, etc.)

**`Mode` Suffix** ‚Üí Operational modes
- Example: (to be discovered during exploration)
- Purpose: Switch between different operating modes
- Values: Mode enums

**Learning:** Suffix patterns help predict API purposes before reading documentation.

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### 1. Assuming Simulator Behavior = Device Behavior

**Problem:**
Visual effects (blur, transparency, edge blending) may render differently on physical devices.

**Solution:**
- Create systematic device testing checklist for all visual APIs
- Document both simulator and device observations
- Add inline comments noting device-specific behaviors

**Example:**
```swift
.scrollEdgeEffectStyle(.soft, for: .top)
// ‚ö†Ô∏è DEVICE NOTE: Fade effect 20% more visible on iPhone 16 Pro vs. simulator
```

---

### 2. Skipping Dark Mode Validation

**Problem:**
Many scroll and visual effects look different against dark backgrounds.

**Solution:**
- Always test both light and dark appearance
- Use Xcode's appearance toggle during testing
- Document dark mode observations separately

**Checklist:**
```markdown
- [ ] Light mode validated
- [ ] Dark mode validated
- [ ] System appearance switching tested
```

---

### 3. Ignoring Edge Cases

**Problem:**
New scroll behaviors may behave unexpectedly with:
- Empty lists (no scrollable content)
- Single item lists (minimal scroll)
- Rapid scroll direction changes

**Solution:**
- Define standard edge case test suite
- Test with varying content lengths
- Document unexpected behaviors

**Standard Edge Cases:**
1. Empty list (0 items)
2. Single item (no scroll)
3. Minimal scroll (2-3 items)
4. Rapid direction change
5. Scroll boundary behavior (top/bottom)

---

### 4. Not Documenting "Why" Decisions

**Problem:**
Future developers (including future you!) won't understand why certain APIs were chosen.

**Solution:**
- Add inline comments explaining expected benefits
- Reference issue numbers for context
- Document alternatives considered

**Example:**
```swift
.tabBarMinimizeBehavior(.onScrollDown)
// iOS 26 API: Dynamic tab hiding for immersive reading experience
// Issue #111 - Chosen over .automatic for predictable behavior
// Alternative considered: .basedOnSize (rejected - inconsistent UX)
```

## Reusable Testing Patterns

### Visual API Testing Checklist

```markdown
**Visual API Testing Protocol:**
- [ ] Simulator: iPhone 17 Pro (iOS 26.0)
- [ ] Physical: [Note device model]
- [ ] Light mode appearance
- [ ] Dark mode appearance
- [ ] All 5 Liquid Glass themes:
  - [ ] liquidBlue
  - [ ] cosmicPurple
  - [ ] forestGreen
  - [ ] sunsetOrange
  - [ ] moonlightSilver
- [ ] Edge cases tested (see list above)
- [ ] Screenshots captured (before/after)
- [ ] Performance measured (60fps maintained?)
```

### Behavioral API Testing Checklist

```markdown
**Behavioral API Testing Protocol:**
- [ ] Expected behavior confirmed (simulator)
- [ ] Expected behavior confirmed (device)
- [ ] Unexpected behaviors documented
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Multi-tab consistency (if applicable)
- [ ] Accessibility impact assessed
- [ ] Performance impact measured
```

## Discovery Insights

### Effective Discovery Methods

**What Works:**
1. **Autocomplete Exploration** - Type prefix + trigger autocomplete in relevant files
   - Example: Type `.scroll` in ScrollView context to see all scroll modifiers
2. **iOS 26 Release Notes** - Official Apple documentation for systematic coverage
3. **HIG "What's New"** - Design-focused API discoveries
4. **Runtime Experimentation** - Try APIs on device to see actual behavior

**What Doesn't Work:**
1. Relying solely on documentation (many APIs underdocumented)
2. Simulator-only testing (misses critical device behaviors)
3. Batch testing without isolating APIs (hard to attribute behaviors)

---

## Performance Observations

_To be populated as APIs are tested..._

**Benchmarking Protocol:**
- Measure frame rate during scroll (target: 60fps)
- Note memory usage changes
- Test with large content sets (100+ items)
- Compare performance before/after API addition

---

## Theme Compatibility Notes

_To be populated as theme testing proceeds..._

**Expected Patterns:**
- Glass effects should enhance all 5 themes equally
- Scroll behaviors should be theme-agnostic
- Edge effects may appear different on light vs. dark base themes

---

## Best Practices Emerging

### 1. Early Device Testing

Test on physical device ASAP - don't wait until PR review.

### 2. Inline Documentation

Every iOS 26 API should have:
```swift
.newAPI()
// iOS 26 API: [What it does]
// Expected: [Benefit]
// Tested: [Device, OS version, themes] ‚úÖ
```

### 3. Issue Reference

Link code to GitHub issues for full context:
```swift
.scrollEdgeEffectStyle(.soft, for: .top)
// iOS 26 API: Edge blending enhancement
// Issue #110 - Part of Scroll Dynamics batch
```

### 4. Screenshot Evidence

Capture before/after screenshots for all visual changes:
- Store in issue comments
- Reference in PR descriptions
- Archive in `docs/experiments/screenshots/` if significant

## Questions for Future Investigation

1. **Do iOS 26 scroll APIs conflict with custom ScrollViewReader implementations?**
   - Test priority: High
   - Impact: May affect bookshelf scanner scroll behavior

2. **Are there performance implications on older devices (iOS 26.0 on iPhone 15)?**
   - Test priority: Medium
   - Impact: Backward compatibility within iOS 26

3. **Do theme changes require API re-evaluation?**
   - Test priority: Low
   - Impact: Dynamic theme switching edge cases
