# books-api-proxy Debugging Guide

**Issue:** All enrichment attempts return 0 results from books-api-proxy
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Context:** Bookshelf scanner hybrid architecture batch 1 testing

---

## üéØ Debugging Objective

Determine why books-api-proxy returns 0 results for common, popular books that should be available in Google Books and OpenLibrary.

---

## üìä Observed Behavior

### Test Case: IMG_0014.jpeg (13 books detected)
**Result:** 13/13 books returned `enrichment.status = "not_found"`

**Sample Failed Books:**
- "Attached" by Amir Levine (1.0 confidence)
- "The Body Keeps the Score" by Bessel van der Kolk (0.95 confidence)
- "The Poppy War" by R.F. Kuang (0.95 confidence)
- "1984" by George Orwell (expected to be in every provider)

**Provider Used:** `orchestrated:google+openlibrary`

## üîç Quick Tests to Run

### Test 1: Known Popular Books
```bash
# Should return results - these are in every database
curl "https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search/title?q=The+Great+Gatsby"
curl "https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search/title?q=Harry+Potter"
curl "https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search/title?q=1984"
```

### Test 2: Advanced Search vs Title Search
```bash
# Test both endpoints
curl "https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search/advanced?title=1984&author=George+Orwell"
curl "https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search/title?q=1984"
```

### Test 3: Author Name Variations
```bash
# Test with full author name vs single author
curl "https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search/advanced?title=Attached&author=Amir+Levine"
curl "https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search/advanced?title=Attached&author=Amir+Levine+and+Rachel+Heller"
```

### Test 4: Check Provider Health
```bash
# Check if each provider is working
curl "https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/health"

# Check recent deployments
cd cloudflare-workers/books-api-proxy
wrangler deployments list
```

### Test 5: Monitor Real-Time Logs
```bash
cd cloudflare-workers/books-api-proxy
wrangler tail --format pretty

# Then in another terminal, trigger a search:
curl "https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search/title?q=1984"
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Files to Investigate

### Primary Investigation Files
```
cloudflare-workers/books-api-proxy/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/index.js                    # Main orchestrator
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/routes/search.js            # Search endpoint handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/providers/                  # Individual provider implementations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ google-books.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ openlibrary.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ isbndb.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wrangler.toml                   # Service bindings configuration
```

### Key Code Sections to Review

**1. `/search/advanced` implementation:**
- How are title + author combined for search?
- Is fuzzy matching enabled?
- Are results being filtered too aggressively?

**2. Provider orchestration:**
- Are providers being called in parallel?
- Is there a timeout cutting off results?
- Are provider errors being swallowed?

**3. Service bindings:**
- Are `google-books-worker` and `openlibrary-worker` deployed?
- Are service bindings configured correctly?

---

## üêõ Potential Root Causes

### Hypothesis 1: Provider Service Bindings Not Working
**Symptom:** RPC calls to underlying workers failing silently
**Test:** Check if google-books-worker and openlibrary-worker are deployed
```bash
cd cloudflare-workers/google-books-worker && wrangler deployments list
cd cloudflare-workers/openlibrary-worker && wrangler deployments list
```

### Hypothesis 2: Strict Matching Algorithm
**Symptom:** Title + Author search requires exact match
**Test:** Compare `/search/title` (fuzzy) vs `/search/advanced` (strict)
**Fix:** Implement fuzzy matching or fallback to title-only search

### Hypothesis 3: Author Name Format Mismatch
**Symptom:** Gemini extracts "Amir Levine and Rachel Heller" but API expects "Amir Levine"
**Test:** Try with single author name vs full name
**Fix:** Normalize author names (take first author only, or try both)

### Hypothesis 4: Cache Returning Empty Results
**Symptom:** Logs show "Cache HIT" but results are empty
**Test:** Clear cache and retry
**Fix:** Investigate cache storage format

### Hypothesis 5: Provider API Keys Missing/Expired
**Symptom:** External APIs (Google Books, ISBNdb) return 401/403
**Test:** Check secrets configuration
```bash
cd cloudflare-workers/books-api-proxy
wrangler secret list
```

## üîß Debugging Commands

### View Recent Requests
```bash
cd cloudflare-workers/books-api-proxy
wrangler tail --format pretty --search "search"
```

### Check KV Cache Contents
```bash
# If using KV for caching
wrangler kv:key list --namespace-id <NAMESPACE_ID>
wrangler kv:key get "search:title:1984" --namespace-id <NAMESPACE_ID>
```

### Test Individual Providers Directly
```bash
# If google-books-worker is exposed
curl "https://google-books-worker.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search?q=1984"

# If openlibrary-worker is exposed
curl "https://openlibrary-worker.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search?q=1984"
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

A successful fix should result in:
1. **Test Case 1:** "The Great Gatsby" returns at least 1 result with ISBN
2. **Test Case 2:** "1984" by George Orwell returns at least 1 result
3. **Test Case 3:** "Attached" by Amir Levine returns at least 1 result
4. **Re-test IMG_0014.jpeg:** At least 50% enrichment success rate (7+/13 books)

## üöÄ After Fix: Resume Hybrid Architecture Plan

Once books-api-proxy is fixed and returning results:

1. **Re-test IMG_0014.jpeg** to validate enrichment success rate
2. **Continue with Task 4-6** (iOS updates - can proceed in parallel)
3. **Resume Task 7** (End-to-End Validation) with fixed backend
4. **Complete Tasks 8-10** (Documentation and changelog)

## üéâ ISSUE RESOLVED - October 14, 2025

### Root Cause
**Field Mismatch:** bookshelf-ai-worker was accessing `apiData.results?.[0]` but books-api-proxy returns data in `apiData.items[0]` (Google Books-style structure).

### Evidence
- ‚úÖ books-api-proxy working perfectly (tested with "The Great Gatsby", "1984", "Attached")
- ‚ùå bookshelf-ai-worker line 396 accessing wrong field ‚Üí always undefined ‚Üí 100% "not_found" rate

### Fix Applied
**File:** `cloudflare-workers/bookshelf-ai-worker/src/index.js:396-417`

**Changes:**
1. Changed `apiData.results?.[0]` ‚Üí `apiData.items?.[0]`
2. Added proper `volumeInfo` field mapping for Google Books structure
3. Fixed ISBN extraction from `industryIdentifiers` array

**Deployed:** Version `24acedc0-ed5c-47be-9698-1128a895f2ca`

### Verification
```bash
# Test books-api-proxy (still working)
curl "https://books-api-proxy.jukasdrj.workers.dev/search/advanced?title=Attached&author=Amir+Levine"

# Test bookshelf-ai-worker health
curl "https://bookshelf-ai-worker.jukasdrj.workers.dev/health"
```

### Expected Results
- **Before Fix:** 0/13 books enriched (100% "not_found")
- **After Fix:** 7+/13 books enriched (50%+ success rate)

### Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Re-test IMG_0014.jpeg enrichment
2. ‚úÖ Continue with hybrid architecture Tasks 4-6 (iOS updates)
3. ‚úÖ Resume Task 7 (End-to-End Validation)

**The hybrid architecture is solid - backend is now cooperating! üéØ**
