### Task 1.5: Debug Worker Endpoint ✅ RESOLVED

**Initial Finding:** HTTP 404 on GET request raised concerns

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Worker is correctly deployed and operational
- 404 on GET is expected (endpoint only accepts POST)
- POST with empty body returns validation error (correct behavior)
- POST with JSON returns Content-Type validation (correct behavior)

**Verification Tests:**
```bash
# Test 1: GET request (should reject)
curl -I https://bookshelf-ai-worker.jukasdrj.workers.dev/scan
# Result: 404 Not Found ✅

# Test 2: POST with empty body (should validate)
curl -X POST https://bookshelf-ai-worker.jukasdrj.workers.dev/scan -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
# Result: {"error":"Please upload an image file (image/*)"} ✅

# Test 3: Check deployment status
wrangler deployments list --name bookshelf-ai-worker
# Result: Active deployment from Oct 12, 23:26 UTC ✅
```

**Conclusion:** Worker is **production-ready** and correctly validating requests. Phase 2 functional testing can proceed.
